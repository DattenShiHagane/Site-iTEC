        <div class="underlinemi"></div>
        <p class="tt12"> Mental illness, also called mental health disorders,
             refers to a wide range of mental health conditions â€” disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior.
             Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors.
            </p>
        <p class="tt13"> Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes 
            a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.
        </p>
        <p class="tt14"> A mental illness can make you miserable and can cause problems in your daily life, such as at school or work or in relationships. 
            In most cases, symptoms can be managed with a combination of medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy).
        </p>
        <p class="tt15"> Symptoms </p>
        <div class="underlines"></div>
        <p class="tt16"> Signs and symptoms of mental illness can vary, depending on the disorder, 
            circumstances and other factors. Mental illness symptoms can affect emotions, thoughts and behaviors.

             but most cases begin earlier in life. The effects of mental illness can be temporary or long lasting. 
            You also can have more than one mental health disorder at the same time. 
            For example, you may have depression and a substance use disorder.</p>

            behavioral and physical health problems.Complications sometimes linked to mental illness include:
