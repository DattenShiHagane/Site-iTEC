        <p class="undertextweight">Strength training goes a long way in terms of supporting bone health, making aerobic exercise more 
        productive, preventing injury, and facilitating healthy aging.</p>
        <p class="undertexgweight1">If you knew that a certain type of exercise could benefit your heart, improve balance, strengthen
        bones and muscle, and help you lose or maintain weight, wouldn't you want to get started? Well, studies show that strength 
        training can provide all those benefits and more.</p>

        <div class="underlinecardio"></div>
        <p class="underlinetextcardio">Cycling. Running. Dancing. Hiking. Kickboxing. When it comes to cardiovascular exercises, the 
        options are endless to improve your overall quality of life. </p>
        <p class="underlinetextcardio1">When part of an overall heart-healthy lifestyle, not only can regular cardio exercise lead to 
        an increase in your resting blood pressure and heart rate, but these basic changes can also mean your heart doesn’t have to
        work unnecessarily hard all of the time.</p>

        <p class="calisthenicstitle">Calisthenics benefits</p>
        <div class="underlinecalisthenics"></div>
        <p class="underlinetextcalisthenics">The benefits of calisthenics depend on your fitness level. For beginners who are only able
        to do 10-12 repetitions at a time, the workout helps build muscle strength. Once you're able to do more reps, calisthenics 
        help increase muscle endurance -- how long you can keep up the exercise.</p>
        <p class="underlinetextcalisthenics1">Because you’re not lifting heavy weights, there is a reduction in risk of injury. You’re
        designed to be able to move yourself in different ways, meaning calisthenics is easier on your tendons, joints and muscles. 
        You recover quicker, meaning your workload increases during the course of your exercise life and you end up getting in more 
        workouts during the course of the year.</p>
